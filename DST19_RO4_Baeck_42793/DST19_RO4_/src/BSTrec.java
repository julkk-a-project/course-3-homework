	   public class BST implements Comparable {	"
	   
	   methods:
	   
	   public boolean isEmpty() 
	   function: checks for an empty tree
	   input: none
	   precondition: the tree has been created
	   output: true if the tree is empty, false otherwise
	   postcondition: true if the tree is empty, false otherwise
	   
	   private boolean findNodeRec(String searchKey, BSTNode subtree, BSTNode subparent)
	   function: find the node that contains searchKey
	   input: searchKey, the (sub)tree that is searched (recursion parameter), the parent 
	   		  of this (sub)tree (recursion parameter)
	   precondition: the tree has been created, no duplicate keys allowed
	   output: true if searchKey is found in the tree, false otherwise
	   postcondition: true if searchKey is found in the tree, false otherwise
	   				  if true, curr points to the node and parent to its parent
	   				  if false, curr is null and parent points to the logical parent
	   				  of a node with searchKey
	   	NB!! A search should always start with findNodeRec(<key>, tree, null) as the
	   	value of the class variable parent is dependent on previous method calls!

	   	input: searchKey

	   	output: the information part of the node containing searchKey, if found, 
	   			null otherwise
	   	postcondition: returns the information part of the node containing searchKey
	   			if searchKey found in the tree, returns null otherwise

	   	// recursive!
	   	function: a node with info part containing keyIn is created and inserted in the tree
	   	input: the key to be inserted, the root of the (sub)tree where insertion is to take 		   place (recursion parameter), the parent of the root of this subtree 
	   		   (recursion parameter), goLeft (true/false) to choose the right subtree
	    precondition: the tree has been created. A node with keyIn is not already present.
	   	output:

		public void deleteNode(String searchKey) // iterative
		function: delete the node containing searchKey
		input: the key for the node to be deleted
		precondition: the tree has been created, no duplicate keys allowed
		output:
		postcondition: the node containing searchKey has been deleted from the tree. curr is 			set to null. parent points to the parent of the deleted node. If the node to
				be deleted was not found in the tree, curr is null and parent points to the
				logical parent of a node with searchKey.
				
		public void inOrder(BSTNode root) // recursive
		function: traverse the tree in inOrder (sorted in ascending order)
		input: the root of the tree to be traversed
		precondition: the tree has been created
		output: the key parts of the information parts, in order, to standard output
		postcondition: the keys are printed in (ascending) order
		
		public void preOrder(BSTNode root) // recursive
		function: traverse the tree in preOrder (node first, then its children)
		input: the root of the tree to be traversed
		precondition: the tree has been created
		output: the key parts of the information parts, in preorder, favoring left, to 	
				standard output
		postcondition: the keys are printed in preorder, favoring left, to 	
				standard output

		input: the root of the tree to be traversed
		precondition: the tree has been created
		output: the key parts of the information parts, in postorder, favoring left, to
